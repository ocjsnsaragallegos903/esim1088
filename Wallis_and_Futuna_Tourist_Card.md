2. **Standard Plan**: If youâ€™re looking for something more robust, the Standard Plan offers unlimited texting and calling, plus 5GB of data. This is great for travelers who plan to stream videos, upload photos, or browse social media while enjoying their island paradise.

3. **Premium Plan**: For tech-savvy travelers who demand the best, the Premium Plan provides everything in the Standard Plan, plus additional features like priority customer support and extended coverage areas. With 10GB of data, youâ€™ll have plenty of room to explore and share your adventures.

One of the standout features of the Wallis and Futuna Tourist Card is its affordability. Compared to traditional roaming plans offered by major carriers, the Tourist Card is significantly cheaper, making it accessible to a wider range of travelers. Plus, there are no hidden fees or restrictionsâ€”what you see is what you get.

Another advantage of using the Tourist Card is its environmental friendliness. By opting for an eSIM instead of a physical SIM card, you help reduce electronic waste, contributing to a cleaner planet. Itâ€™s a small step, but every little bit counts when it comes to sustainability.
