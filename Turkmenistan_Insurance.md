Another trend gaining popularity is eSIM technology. Unlike traditional SIM cards, eSIMs are embedded directly into your device, offering convenience and versatility. With eSIMs, you can switch between multiple numbers and carriers effortlessly, which is particularly useful if you travel frequently. Imagine having a local number in Turkmenistan while maintaining your international lineâ€”itâ€™s like having two phones in one!
