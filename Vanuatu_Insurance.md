But letâ€™s not forget about another crucial aspect of traveling: staying connected. In todayâ€™s digital age, having reliable internet access is as important as having travel insurance. This is where our mobile and data solutions come in handy. We offer a variety of SIM cards and eSIMs designed specifically for travelers visiting Vanuatu. 

For those who prefer physical SIM cards, we provide prepaid options that are easy to set up upon arrival at the airport. These cards are perfect for tourists who want affordable rates and flexibility. You can top them up as needed, ensuring you never run out of minutes or data during your stay. Plus, our customer service team is always available to help with any questions or issues you may encounter.

On the other hand, if youâ€™re looking for something more modern and convenient, our eSIMs are an excellent choice. Unlike traditional SIM cards, eSIMs allow you to connect instantly without needing to swap out physical chips. Simply download the eSIM profile onto your compatible device, and youâ€™re ready to go! Our eSIMs support multiple networks, providing seamless coverage across Vanuatu and beyond. Whether youâ€™re streaming videos, checking emails, or sharing photos with loved ones back home, our eSIMs deliver fast and reliable connectivity wherever you are.

Another exciting option is our local SIM cards, which cater to both short-term and long-term users. These cards often come with attractive bundles that include generous amounts of data, calls, and texts. Theyâ€™re ideal for individuals who plan to spend extended periods in Vanuatu, such as expats, students, or professionals working remotely. With these cards, youâ€™ll enjoy local pricing, making your communication costs much more manageable.

In addition to these offerings, we also provide international roaming services for travelers who need to stay connected abroad.
